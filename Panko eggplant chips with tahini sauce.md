## Ingredients

-   2 eggplants
-   Salt and black pepper
-   1 cup plain flour
-   1 tsp sweet paprika
-   1 tsp ground cumin
-   2 eggs
-   1 tbsp water
-   ⅔ cup panko breadcrumbs
-   ⅓ cup finely shredded coconut
-   2 tbsp black sesame seeds
-   Sunflower oil, for deep-frying
-   2 spring onion stalks, thinly sliced
-   1 long red chilli, thinly sliced

**For the tahini sauce**  

-   ⅓ cup tahini
-   ¼ cup (60 ml) lemon juice
-   2 tbsp maple syrup
-   2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
-   Salt and black pepper
-   2 - 3 tbsp water

## Instructions

1.  Cut the eggplants (skin-on) into thick chips and transfer to a large baking tray. Season with salt generously and allow to stand for 20 minutes. Use paper towel to wipe the eggplant chips dry, then transfer to a clean bowl.  
    
2.  Prepare a crumbing station with three shallow bowls. In the first, combine the flour, ½ tsp salt, some black pepper and the spices. In the second, whisk the eggs with 1 tbsp water and in the third, combine the panko, coconut and sesame seeds.  
    
3.  Dip one eggplant chip into the flour, followed by the beaten eggs and finally the panko, turning to coat well, then transfer to a prepared tray, ready to fry. Repeat with remaining eggplant chips.  
    
4.  In a large saucepan, heat enough sunflower oil to deep-fry the eggplant chips. When hot, fry the crumbed chips in batches until golden brown, taking care not to burn them. You may need to lower the heat if they are browning too fast. Remove the chips to a paper towel-lined tray and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Deep-fry the sliced spring onion and chilli until crisp, then remove from the oil with a slotted spoon.  
    
5.  To make the dipping sauce, in a medium bowl, combine the tahini, lemon juice, maple syrup, garlic and a generous pinch of salt and pepper and whisk well to combine. Gradually add water while whisking until it reaches a pourable consistency. Transfer to a dipping bowl.  
    
6.  Place the eggplant chips onto a serving platter and sprinkle with the crisp spring onion and chilli. Serve with the tahini dipping sauce.
