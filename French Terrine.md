## Equipment

## Instructions

Making pâté at home isn’t difficult, but it is a project. Cooking it the traditional way can be a little frustrating, because you can work through a bunch of steps to prep the thing just right, then overcook it all too easily. Here, we get around that risk by cooking the pâté sous vide, ensuring that it emerges exactly the way we like it. Read on for the full five-step process of making an incredible rustic pâté that’s far less expensive than the stuff at your favorite specialty grocery—but with a texture and flavor that blow the store-bought stuff right out of the water.

* How long will this stuff last in the fridge? About a month.

### 1. Make the Filling

1.a. Before you start cooking, place thinly sliced [[bacon]] (for the lining) and grinder parts in the freezer. We aren’t freezing them through here, just getting them real chill so they are easy to work with.

  * [[Bacon]], thinly sliced, about 0.5 package, as needed

1.b. Grind those spices in your spice grinder.

   * 2.5g Yellow [[mustard]] seed
   * 2.5g [[Coriander seed]]
   * 1.5g Black pepper
   * 1.3g [[Allspice]]
   * 0.75g [[Clove]]

1.c. Combine Salts by adding salts to a small [[bowl]] on your digital scale and stir to combine. Set aside.

  * 15g Salt
  * 1.5g [[Prague Powder]] No. 1

1.d. Chop the meat, season, and get it in the freezer. Cut the shoulder, [[bacon]], and liver into small chunks that will fit into your meat grinder Combine the meats on a tray, and sprinkle generously with your spice mix. Now transfer those meats to the freezer so they can

hang with their buddies, grinder and [[bacon]].

  * 550g [[Pork shoulder]]
  * 200g [[Pork liver]]
  * 150g Slab [[bacon]] for the filling

### 2. Make the Binder (Panade)

* 37.5g Bread such as sourdough, crust removed
* 50g [[Eggs]] about 1 whole
* 37.5g Milk whole

2.a. Remove the crust from your bread, and discard. (We discard the crust into our mouths as a snack, but you do you.) Chop bread into cubes; you’ll need to end up with about 37.5g.

2.b. Add bread, [[eggs|egg]], and milk to a [[bowl]], and blend with an immersion blender until you get a smooth, pastelike texture.

Store in the fridge.

### 3. Line Terrine Molds with [[bacon]]

3.a. Lining your molds with [[bacon]] (or other sources of fat, like pork caul or poultry skin) is always optional, but it will make your pâté look and taste great. If you aren’t lining your loaves, we still suggest following the steps for wrapping them in plastic so that they will slide right out of the molds after you cook them.

3.b. Wrap mold with plastic. Dip a clean kitchen towel in ice water, and dab the insides of your terrine molds all over. This will help prevent the plastic wrap from sticking. You can use cooking spray instead if you want.

Line the molds with plastic wrap, and use the damp towel to press the plastic to the sides and get rid of any air bubbles.

* Cold water, as needed
* Ice, as needed

3.c. Add [[bacon]]:

* [[Bacon]], thinly sliced, about 1 package, as needed

Working from one end of a terrine mold to the other, line with [[bacon]] strips. Push the strips gently into the corners, and let them overlap so that they cover all surfaces. The strips should hang over the sides of the terrines—we’ll be covering the pâté with those in a minute.

### 4. Fill Paté

4.a. Grind meat

* Cold water, as needed
* Ice, as needed

Set up an ice bath. Remove the grinder parts from the freezer, and reassemble them. Grab the meat chunks, and grind them coarsely, working as quickly as possible. Store ground meat in a [[bowl]] over your ice bath.

4.b. Add the binder (panade) and garnishes

* 25g [[Cramberries]]
* 50g [[Pistachios]]
* 40g [[Sauternes]] (or other dessert wine) / [[Gewurztraminer]]
* 1.5g [[Thyme]], fresh, chopped

Add the panade to the ground meat and stir just until combined. Stir in [[cramberries]], [[pistachios]], wine, and [[thyme]].

4.c. Pack terrine molds

Fill each lined terrine mold with meat, leaving about a quarter-inch (or a little less than a centimeter) of space at the top. Pack it in there densely; air bubbles are the enemy. Fold the strips over the top, and trim as necessary. Fold the plastic wrap over the top to close.

NOTE: You can fill the terrine molds all the way to the top if you want. Just keep in mind that the pâté will take longer to cook to core temperature.

### 5. Cook; Press (optional)

* Cook 2 hours at 167 °F / 75 °C

Grab a large roasting pan or some other [[oven]]-safe vessel that your terrine molds will fit into easily. Place two chopsticks on the bottom of the pan.

Add the terrine molds so that they sit atop the chopsticks. This trick will allow water to get underneath and help your pâté cook evenly.

Plug in Joule or other sous vide tool and pop it in the pan. Set your sink tap to the hottest setting, and fill a pitcher with the hot water. Add water to the pan until it reaches the top edge of the terrine mold, and set Joule to 167 °F / 75 °C.

Cook pâté until a thermometer inserted inside of it reaches 147 °F / 64 °C, about two hours.

5.b. Press

To get really amazing, even slices, press your terrine: Start by poking a small hole in the plastic on one side of the pâté. This will release some of the fat and moisture that have accumulated, preventing them from shooting out in your face.

Now, if you have extra terrine molds, you can use them to press your pâté. Or you can do this: take a couple pieces of cardboard and cut them into the same shape as the terrines. Wrap them in plastic, place them on top of the pâté, and then add some cans on top for weight.

### 6. Chill

Whether or not you are pressing, chill that loaf overnight in the fridge.

When you are ready to serve some pâté, gently turn a terrine mold upside down and slowly pull on the plastic wrap on one side. After a few seconds, your pâté should pop right out.

Remove the plastic, wipe away any excess fat and gelatin that have accumulated, and serve!

To store, keep the pâté wrapped in the plastic. It will last for about a month or so in the fridge.

### 7. Wrap the [[shortcrust pastry]]

* 2 Sheets of [[Shortcrust Pastry]]
* Yolks for [[eggs|egg]] wash

Open the sheets and wash them with [[eggs|egg]] yolks.

Wrap the pastry around the pâté, and place it in the [[oven]] at 220 °C for 20 minutes.
