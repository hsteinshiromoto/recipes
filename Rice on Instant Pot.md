## Hints

### Want Fluffy Rice? Rinse Well

I don’t always remember or have time to do this step, but it helps when I do: Rinse the rice in a wire mesh colander under cold water for 30 seconds or so, or until the water runs mostly clear.

Rinsing makes the rice fluffy, and seems to make more of a difference with white rice varieties verses brown; the latter is protected by its hull and doesn’t tend to have a lot of extra starch clinging to the outside of the grains.

### Use a Natural Pressure Release

No matter what kind of rice you’re cooking, it’s a good idea to let the pressure release naturally for 10 minutes before opening the pot. This allows the moisture to distribute evenly throughout the grains, and helps it unstick from the bottom of the pot, too.

You _can_ open the pot with a quick pressure release if you like, but it really does benefit from a little resting time!

### How Much Rice is the Minimum?

One last rule of thumb to keep in mind is that you’ll need to cook **at least 1 1/2 cups of rice in a 6-quart pressure cooker** to get nice, even results. This is because the bottom of the pot isn’t perfectly flat, but slightly concave. If you use less rice, the grains in the middle of the pot will not cook as evenly, since they won’t be submerged in the water as much as the rice on the sides of the pot.
