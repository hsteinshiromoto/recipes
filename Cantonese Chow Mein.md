# Cantonese Chow Mein

## Ingredients

- 340 g Hong Kong style pan fried noodles (buy the unsteamed variety)
- 0.50 [[onion]]
- 5 piece [[scallion|green onion]]
- 113 g [[bean sprouts]]
- 14.8 mL [[dark soy sauce]] or [[Tamari]]
- 14.8 mL [[light soy sauce]]
- 14.8 mL [[oyster sauce]]
- 9.9 mL sugar
- 14.8 mL water
- 4.9 mL [[sesame oil]]

## Equipment

* [[Wok]]
* [[Bowl]]

## Instructions

### 1. Steam Noodles, Drain, Cool

- Place your steamer rack in a [[wok]] on high heat. Pour enough water so that the top of the rack isn't submerged, and start boiling water.
- Take the rack out, separate and lay out noodles (340 g) on top of the rack.
- Once boiling, set the steamer rack + noodles back in the [[wok]] and cover for 10 minutes. Leave the stove on high heat.
- If you're using a steamer rack without holes (i.e. steaming on a plate where the steam can't easily access the bottom, steam for 2-3 extra minutes.)
- Once the 10 minutes is up, quickly dump the noodles in the water for 15-30 seconds.
- Drain the noodles through a colander, and spend about 1-2 minutes fluffing and separating the noodles with a chopstick.
- Let it cool for 3-5 minutes.

If you're using fresh, steamed noodles, you can skip the steaming step. Instead dunk the noodles in boiling water for about 2 minutes before draining.

If you're using dried noodles, it's somewhat similar to cooking instant ramen. Cook according to the package's instructions, erring on the more al-dente side, and rinse with cold water afterwards to stop the cooking.

### 2. Chop Vegetables

- [[scallion|green onion]] (5 piece) - cut into about 1.5 inch pieces. Separate the roots and the shoots, as we'll be cooking the roots first.
- [[onion]] (0.50 ) - cut in half, and then julienne (see video for example)
- [[bean sprouts]] (113 g) - you can leave these as is. Some traditional restaurants will remove the beans and the tips, which is A LOT of work.. but feel free.

### 3. Create Sauce

Mix [[dark soy sauce]] (14.8 mL), [[light soy sauce]] (14.8 mL), [[oyster sauce]] (14.8 mL), sugar (9.9 mL), water (14.8 mL) in a [[bowl]] until the sugar dissolves.

### 4. Heat Wok, Start Cooking

We'll start by heating our [[wok]] to around 350-400°F (176-204°C). Depending on your stove, this should take around 2-3 minutes.

AFTER the [[wok]] is hot, we'll add corn oil (14.6 mL) and heat that to 350-400°F. As a visual cue, it should be "shimmering" - rippling, but not smoking. If it's started smoking, the [[wok]] is too hot.

Then, we'll start cooking our [[scallion|green onion]] roots and [[onion|onions]] for right around 1 minute, and set them on a plate for later.

Heat the [[wok]] again and add more corn oil (14.6 mL). Once the oil is shimmering, add the noodles.

We want to be really gentle with the noodles. DO NOT flip them yet, and only occasionally move the noodles around. Let the bottom get nice and crispy for about 3 minutes.

Then, we'll flip. My dad does a graceful [[wok]]-flip (which I don't have the confidence to pull off), but the rest of us can just use a spatula and flip that way :)

Once flipped, add more corn oil (14.6 mL) along the perimeter of the noodles to help develop a nice crisp. Let the noodles cook on this side for another 3 minutes, occasionally prodding and moving the noodles.

Letting the noodles adequately cook and crisp on each side is one of the main keys to perfecting this dish.

### 5: Cook Bean Sprouts, Add Veggies, Flavors

Overview

- [[Bean sprouts]]: 30-45 seconds
- Green [[onion|onions]] + [[onion|onions]]: 1-2 minutes
- Sauce: 1 minute
- [[Sesame oil]]: 1-2 minutes

Add the [[bean sprouts]]:

- Make room for the [[bean sprouts]] by pushing the noodles aside in the [[wok]].
- Set the [[bean sprouts]] in the [[wok]], and then cover them with the noodles. This helps trap some of the heat inside to help them cook more evenly and quickly.
- Let the [[bean sprouts]] cook underneath the noodles for 30-45 seconds.

Add the green [[onion|onions]] (everything, the cooked roots + raw shoots) and [[onion|onions]], and cook for about 1-2 minutes. Continue separating the noodles with chopsticks and a spatula.

Pour in the sauce mix, and mix everything around for 1 minute. We'll want to let the sauce evaporate as much as we can.

Add [[sesame oil]] (4.9 mL), and mix and separate the noodles for another 1-2 minutes, and then we can start plating.

At this point, you should taste the noodles and see if the flavor and color is to your liking. My dad added another splash of [[dark soy sauce]] (0.5 tbsp) in the video to make the noodles a little darker.
