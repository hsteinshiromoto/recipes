1. Soak the dried '[[tangerine]]' peel for one hour until soft. Scrape off the bitter white pith (thoroughly!), and finely mince.
2. Pound together all the ingredients except for the sauces, then once pasty, mix in said sauces.
3. If using this sauce as a dip or a spread (i.e. not as a base for a stir fry), cook the sauce first. Tablespoon or so of oil, medium flame, cook the sauce until the oil separates, ~2 minutes.
4. Swirl in a tablespoon of liaojiu a.k.a. Shaoxing wine, then add in 1/4 cup of water.
5. Swap the flame to high, reduce until the water is mostly gone, ~8 minutes.
