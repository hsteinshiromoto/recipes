# Sweet and Spicy Steak Rice Bowl

## Ingredients

**Steak**

- 350 g (0.75 lb) [[flank steak]] (or cut of choice), cubed
- 10 g (2 tsp) peanut or neutral oil (for cooking)
- Kosher salt

**Sweet & Spicy Stir Fry Sauce**

- 10 g (2 tsp) [[soy sauce]]
- 15 g (1 tbsp) [[hoisin]]
- 10 g (2 tsp) chili garlic paste ([[Sambal]] Oelek)
- 5 g (1 tsp) toasted [[sesame seeds]]

**Sauteed Vegetables**

- 5 [[shitake]] mushrooms, thinly sliced
- 1/2 bunch of asparagus, woody stem section removed, and chopped into 1‚Äù pieces or [[snow peas]]
- 2 cloves [[garlic]], thinly sliced
- 5 g (1 tsp) peanut or neutral oil (for cooking)
- Kosher salt
- Sprinkle of MSG, **optional**

**Bowl Components & Garnishes**

- Serving of leftover rice
- Additional toasted sesame seeds
- [[Pickled ginger]]
- [[scallion|scallions]], thinly sliced
- 3 g [[Kewpie|kewpie mayo]], **optional**

## Instructions

**Make the sauce:**

Combine all **Sweet & Spicy Stir Fry Sauce** ingredients together until homogeneous. Set aside.

**Stir fry the vegetables:**

To cook, heat a [[wok]] (or a large fry pan) over high heat. Add 5 grams of neutral oil and the garlic and cook for 20 seconds. Add the mushrooms and asparagus with a pinch of salt and saute for a couple of minutes. Set aside, and wipe the wok clean.

**Stir fry the steak:**

Heat the wok until smoking again and add oil to the pan. Add steak cubes and let them sear on one side for a couple of minutes to brown the exterior. Toss to release and cook the other sides of the steak, then add the stir-fry sauce. Cook for another minute or so to let the sauce reduce and glaze the steak.

**Assemble and serve:** I added a serving of leftover rice, half of the veggies, and more toasted sesame seeds to the steak, but make a portion to your desired preference and ratio. Don't forget the garnishes: kewpie mayo, leftover sauce, pickled ginger, and scallions.
