# Tomatoes with Smoky and Salty Feta Cheese

## Ingredients

* 1 teaspoon [[liquid smoke]]
* 5 ounces block [[Fetta]][^1], with 1 cup of its brine (see note)
* 1 1/2 pounds ripe beefsteak [[Tomato|tomatoes]] (about 2 large), cut into slices
* 1/2 pound cherry [[Tomato|tomatoes]], split in half
* Kosher salt
* 1/2 recipe [Easy Pie Dough](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2011/07/easy-pie-dough-recipe.html)
* 2 tablespoons whole-grain [[mustard]]
* Freshly ground black pepper
* 2 tablespoons extra-virgin [[olive oil]], plus more for finishing
* 1 tablespoon minced fresh [[oregano]], [[marjoram]], and/or [[thyme]] leaves
* 2 tablespoons minced fresh delicate herbs, such as [[Parsley]], [[mint]], [[basil]], [[tarragon]], and/or [[chives]]

## Equipment

* [[Baking tray]]
* 10-inch fluted [[tart pan]]
* [[rolling pin]]

## Instructions

1. Adjust an [[oven]] rack to the center position and preheat [[oven]] to 400Â°F. Add [[liquid smoke]] to feta brine, cutting or crumbling the cheese to make sure it is submerged. Set feta and brine aside.
2. Place beefsteak [[tomato]] slices and halved cherry [[Tomato|tomatoes]] in a single layer on a baking sheet lined with two layers of paper towels or a clean kitchen towel. Season with salt. Flip [[Tomato|tomatoes]] and season second side. Set aside for 15 minutes, then blot excess liquid with more paper towels.
3. Carefully roll out cold pie dough into a circle that overlaps a 10-inch fluted [[tart pan]]. Use your [[rolling pin]] to carefully transfer dough to pan. Push it into corners with your fingertips and trim off excess with a butter knife. Transfer to freezer for 5 minutes.
4. Remove tart crust from freezer. Using the back of a spoon, spread [[mustard]] evenly over bottom surface. Layer [[Tomato|tomatoes]] into tart crust, fitting them as tightly together as possible. Drain smoky [[Fetta]] and crumble over the top. Season with black pepper. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons extra-virgin [[olive oil]] and sprinkle with [[oregano]], [[marjoram]], and/or [[thyme]] leaves.
1. Transfer tart to [[oven]] and bake until bottom is well browned and crisp and top is sizzling, with [[Tomato|tomatoes]] and cheese lightly browned and most of the liquid evaporated, about 1 hour. Remove from oven and let cool to room temperature. Sprinkle with remaining herbs, drizzle with a little more [[olive oil]], and serve.

[^1]: If using [[Fetta]] that's not packaged in brine, dissolve 1 tablespoon kosher salt in 1 cup of water, then place the cheese and the brine together in a small [[bowl]] or plastic deli container and follow the recipe as written.

## Why It Works

* Salting the [[Tomato|tomatoes]] and letting them drain before adding them to the tart ensures that your tart ends up intense and jammy instead of watery.
* A layer of whole-grain [[mustard]] spread over the bottom of the tart adds a pungent bite.
* A touch of [[liquid smoke]] added to the [[Fetta]] brine gives it a lightly smoky flavor.
