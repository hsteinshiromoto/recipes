# Thai Basil Chicken Stir Fry

## Ingredients

- 1 [[Chicken Breast]], cubed into bite-sized pieces
- Salt
- Green Vegetable of Choice (Sea Beans, Asparagus, [[Snow Peas]], [[Kale]])
- 1-inch Knob of [[Ginger]], diced
- 1 [[scallion|Green Onion]], thinly sliced
- 2-3 Thai Chiles (or 1 Serrano), thinly sliced
- 10-20 [[Thai Basil]] Leaves, ripped or chopped
- Sprinkle of MSG (optional)
- 30 g Neutral Oil (Peanut, Vegetable, etc.)

## Equipment

## Instructions

1. Cube the chicken into 1/2-1 inch bite-sized pieces, and sprinkle with salt. If time permits, complete this step up to a day ahead of time and let the chicken dry brine even longer in the fridge.
2. Chop your green vegetable down to a manageable stir fry size, if applicable. Dice the [[ginger]] and chilies, and thinly slice the [[scallion|green onion]]. Rip or rough chop the basil leaves.
3. Then, assemble the [[Prik Nam Pla]] sauce: Combine your diced chilies with the [[fish sauce]] and [[Lime Juice]] in a container. Optionally, you can grate in a clove of [[Garlic]] for more pungency or add a pinch of sugar to taste. Thatâ€™s it.
4. Set a wok over medium heat and add about 15g or half of your oil.
5. Add the minced [[ginger]], sliced [[scallion|green onion]], and chili. Let saute for about a minute to infuse those flavors into the oil.
6. Toss in the green vegetables along with a little pinch of salt and saute for 2-3 minutes.
7. Remove the cooked vegetables from the wok and set aside on a plate or [[bowl]].
8. Turn the heat up to high and add another 15g or the remaining oil.
9. Toss in the chicken and sear on the heat until cooked through.
10. Return the aromatic vegetables to the wok with the chicken and lastly toss in the ripped [[Thai basil]]. Stir fry everything together for another minute and then turn off the heat. Optionally, I add a pinch of msg to mine to finish.
11. To serve, set some rice down and add a heaping amount of the chicken and veggies. Drizzle a spoonful of [[prik nam pla]] over top and devour.
