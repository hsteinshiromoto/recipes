## Instructions

**Pickle the carrots:**

Add the julienned [[carrots]] and sliced serranos to a jar and pour over a mixture of boiling water, [[Rice Vinegar|rice wine vinegar]], and salt. These will be ready for use once cooled and will get more pickled over time. The jar can be stored in the fridge for a long time.

**Make the seasoning sauce & marinate the tuna:**

Add all **Seasoning Sauce** ingredients to a bowl and mix until homogenous.

Combine this sauce in a bowl with all **Seasoned Tuna ingredients** so that everything is coated. Let marinade for a few minutes.

**Assemble & serve:**

Add warmed leftover rice to a bowl. Then a a sprinkle of [[furikake]] seasoning to create a little crunchy layer before adding the marinated tuna mixture over the top.

Lastly, top with the spicy pickled carrot mixture.

## Notes & Variations

Use any vegetables or toppings you have around. Sushi-grade salmon is a great substitute for the tuna.
