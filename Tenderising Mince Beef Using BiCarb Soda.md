# Tenderising Mince Beef Using BiCarb Soda

## Ingredients

- 1 pound (500g) of [[Beef Mince|beef mince]]
- 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of [[Baking Soda]]

## Instructions

1. Sprinkle [[Baking Soda]] over the [[Beef Mince|beef mince]]. Try to distribute the [[Baking Soda]] as evenly as possible. I like to add the baking soda to 1 tablespoon of water first, whichÂ  helps ensure it will be evenly distributed through the beef.
2. Stir the baking soda mixture into the beef until well combined.
3. **Let it rest.** Set the beef aside for about **15 minutes** before proceeding to cook.
