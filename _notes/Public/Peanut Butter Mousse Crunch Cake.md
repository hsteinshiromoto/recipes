## Equipment

## Instructions

1. Heat the [[oven]] to 350°F. Line a sheet pan with a silicone baking mat or parchment paper and set an 8-inch (20-centimeter) cake ring in the pan.
2. Coat the [[puffed rice]]: Put the [[puffed rice]] in a large [[bowl]]. Put the [[corn syrup]] in a small heatproof [[bowl]] and microwave for 30 seconds, then pour the warm [[corn syrup]] over the [[puffed rice]]. Sprinkle with the sugar, then mix with a spatula until the rice is evenly coated. (You may find that using your hands is easier).
3. Shape the [[puffed rice]]: Transfer the [[puffed rice]] to the cake ring, pressing it into an even layer about ¼ inch (6 millimeters) thick. If you plan on using the caramelized [[puffed rice]] as a topping, separate it in clusters on a sheet pan.
4. Bake the [[puffed rice]] for 10 to 15 minutes, until golden-brown and caramelized. Let the [[puffed rice]] cool completely in the cake ring. Unmold the [[puffed rice]], then carefully peel away the silicone mat or parchment.
5. Put the [[chocolate]] in a heatproof [[bowl]]. Microwave in 10-to-15 second intervals, stirring after each, until just melted \-- don\'t let it get too hot. Line a sheet pan or an 8-inch (20-centimeter) cake pan with parchment paper. Place the disc of [[puffed rice]] in a large [[bowl]]. With your hands, break it into smaller pieces. Pour the melted [[chocolate]] over the [[puffed rice]] and fold with a spatula until coated.
6. Spread the coated [[puffed rice]] over the prepared sheet pan or press it into the prepared cake pan. Refrigerate until firm, about 20 minutes. Gently unmold the [[puffed rice]] and remove the parchment. (Work quickly, or the [[chocolate]] will melt.)
7. Make the [[peanut butter]] mousse[^1] : Combine the gelatin and cold water in a small [[bowl]] and stir with a spoon until the gelatin has dissolved. Put the milk in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat. Remove from heat and keep warm.
8. Make the custard: Whisk together the [[eggs|egg]] yolks and sugar in a large [[bowl]] until combined. While whisking, slowly pour in a little bit of the hot milk to temper the [[eggs]] and whisk until combined. Whisk in a bit more of the milk, then pour the tempered [[eggs|egg]] mixture into the saucepan with the remaining milk.
9. Cook the custard over medium-low, gently stirring with a spatula, until thick enough to coat the back of the spatula, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat. While the custard is still warm, add the [[peanut butter]], then the gelatin mixture, and stir until combined. Let cool completely, about 30 minutes, or refrigerate for 10 to 15 minutes.
10. In a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment (or in a large [[bowl]] using a hand mixer or whisk), whip the cream on medium speed until it holds soft peaks, about 5 minutes. Slowly pour the custard into the whipped cream a little at a time, gently folding with a spatula until just combined.
11. Make the dark [[chocolate]] ganache: Combine the cream and the milk in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat. Remove from the heat and keep warm.
12. Place the [[chocolate]] in a large [[bowl]]. Slowly pour the cream mixture over the [[chocolate]] and whisk until the [[chocolate]] has melted and the mixture is smooth. Add the [[butter]] and whisk until fully incorporated. Let cool completely.
1. Assemble the cake

[^1]: If your [[peanut butter]] is particularly thick, put it in a medium [[bowl]], add a scoop of the custard, and stir with a spatula to loosen it, then add the [[peanut butter]] mixture to the saucepan with the remaining custard.
