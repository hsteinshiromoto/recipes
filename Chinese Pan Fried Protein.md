# Chinese Pan Fried Protein

## Ingredients

### Main Ingredients

- 1kg [[Chicken Thighs]] or [[pork chops]]
- 1.5 [[onion|red onion]]
- 1.5 [[onion|white onion]]
- 7 cloves [[garlic]]
- 100 mL [[corn flour]]
- 70 mL peanut oil

### Marinade

- 40 mL [[Oyster Sauce]]
- 40 mL [[Soy Sauce]]
- 40 mL [[Shaoxing wine]]
- 11g salt
- 11g sugar
- 6g white pepper
- 70g [[corn flour]]
- 30g [[ginger]]

### Miscellaneous

- 40 mL [[Shaoxing wine]]
- 6g [[garlic salt]]

## Equipment

## Instructions

### 1. Prepare the Marinade

- Mince the [[ginger]] and mix all the ingredients.

### 2. Cut the Aromatics

- Mince the [[Garlic]]
- Cut the [[onion|white onion]] and the [[onion|red onion]] into slices; the thickness is up to how crunchy you like your onions. Slice them more thinly if you want them to melt into the dish, or cut thicker slices if you prefer crisp bites of onion.

### 3. Prepare the Protein

- If using chicken thighs, trim the protein.
- If using pork chops, set the pork chops down on a sturdy cutting board. Tenderize and flatten the meat with the back of your knife or a mallet. Thoroughly pound the meat with your knife angled in one direction, then change your angle 90 degrees and pound the meat one more time to create a cross-hatch pattern. This step is important for that ideal tender texture, so your pork chops won't turn out dense and rough.

### 4. Marinate the Protein

- Dry each piece of the protein with a clean towel or paper towel, then place them into the bowl of marinade. Coat each piece thoroughly, then set aside for about 10 minutes. For maximum penetration of the flavor, keep the meat-side down facing the marinade (as opposed to the skin side which wouldn't absorb the marinade as well).
- When they’ve finished marinating to your satisfaction, spread an even layer of cornstarch on a plate, and coat each side of the thighs with a thin layer of cornstarch. Gently shake off excess cornstarch.

### 5. Pan-fry the Protein

- Heat a skillet or flat-bottomed wok on high heat. Once it’s hot, add peanut oil.
- When the oil’s shimmering, turn the heat to medium-low, and place each piece of the protein (skin-side down in case of chicken). Cook until golden brown, or about 2-3 minutes.
- Flip the protein over and cook the other side until it’s also golden brown, or about 5-6 minutes.
- When both sides are beautifully golden brown, flip all the pieces back to the skin side and cook for another 1-2 minutes to make it crispy.

### 7. Add Aromatics & Final Seasoning

- Make some room by pushing the protein to the sides of the pan. Add the minced garlic to the now-vacated middle of the pan, and cook until fragrant, or 10 seconds.
- Add the sliced onion and spread it out in the pan as you cook until that’s also fragrant, or 20 seconds.
- Pour cooking wine into the pan and immediately cover with the lid. This allows the steam to cook everything further while melding all the aromas and flavors together.
- Turn the heat to high to reduce the sauce down. Cook covered like this for just 30-40 seconds.
- Uncover the pan and sprinkle garlic salt over the protein for a final touch of seasoning. Give everything a quick mix to distribute. Plate your creation by creating a bed of onions on the bottom, perching the chicken thighs on top, and decorating with the most beautiful pieces of onion on top. Enjoy!
