# Chicken Shawarma

## Ingredients

### Chicken

- 2lbs boneless skinless [[Chicken Thighs|chicken thighs]]
- 200g or 3/4c plain greek [[Yoghurt]]
- 20g [[Lemon|lemon juice]] or juice of 1/2 large lemon
- 10g or 1Tbsp [[Garlic Power|garlic powder]]
- 1g or 2tsp dried [[thyme]]
- 5g or 2 1/2tsp ground [[cumin]]
- 1g or 2tsp dried [[oregano]]
- 2g ground [[Coriander Seed|coriander seeds]]
- 5g [[garam masala]]
- 1g or 1tsp ground black pepper
- 20g or 3 1/2 tsp salt

Add all ingredients to bowl and mix to combine and coat chicken well. Cover and let marinate in the fridge for at least 20min or up to 8 hours. Add a little less salt if marinating for 8hrs.

Preheat broiler to high with oven rack set as close to broiler as possible.

Line [[Baking tray|sheet tray]] with foil. place thighs on foil and cook under broiler for 10-12 minutes until a bit of char has developed. After desired amount of char on side 1, flip thighs to second side and continue cooking for another 10-12mins or until internal temp reaches 165F/74C or above. ALWAYS KEEP AN EYE ON CHICKEN while under broiler. Things can burn quickly and cook time varies depending on your oven.

Thinly slice.

### Tahini Sauce

- 150g or 3/4c [[tahini]] (loose texture preferred as shown @1:27)
- 30g or 2Tbsp [[Lemon|lemon juice]]
- 100-120g or 1/4c+ water (use more water if your tahini is on the thick side)
- 2g or 1/3tsp salt
- 1 [[garlic]] clove, roughly sliced

Add ingredients into a high sided container and blend with immersion blender (or in conventional blender) until well blended and saucy.

### Tomato Cucumber "Pico De Gallo"

- 150g or 3/4c diced [[Tomato|tomatoes]]
- 125-150g or 3/4c diced [[Cucumber|cucumbers]]
- 10g or about 1/4 bunch of [[Parsley|parsley]], chopped
- 3g or 1/2tsp salt

### Additional Toppings

- Flour [[Tortilla|tortillas]]
- Sliced dill [[pickles]] (I'm using bubbies for this recipe)
- [[Sambal]] chili sauce
- Thinly shredded [[lettuce]] (I'm using little gem here)

### To Build Shawarma Tacos

Heat flour tortillas in a nonstick skillet over medium until soft. Keep warm in tortilla warmer. Build tacos by adding chopped chicken, 2-3 spoons of pico de gallo, pickled pepper slices, sliced dill pickle chips, sambal to taste, plenty tahini sauce, and a generous handful of shredded lettuce.
