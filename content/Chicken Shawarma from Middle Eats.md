## Instructions

### Marinade Directions

 1. Butterfly or pound your chicken thighs until they are 1/2 cm or 1/4 inch thick
 2. Crush your bay leaves using a pestle and mortar, then add to a bowl with the remaining spices
 3. Mince your garlic and mix with the Yoghurt, Tomato Paste, Lemon Juice, Olive oil, white vinegar and the spice mix. Stir until well mixed and then add your chicken in to the bowl and mix to ensure each piece is well coated in the marinade
 4. Place your chicken in the fridge for a minimum of 12 hours so the marinade can penetrate the chicken

### Oven Grilled Shawarma Directions

 1. Slice your chicken thighs into strips about 1/2 cm or 1/4 inch thick
 2. Using a metal skewer, pierce your chicken strips all along one side and slide them onto the skewer
 3. With a second metal skewer, pierce the opposite end of the chicken, so that the chicken strips are suspended between both skewers
 4. Line a baking sheet with foil, then place the skewers on the edge of the sheet. They should be floating above the sheet not sitting in it (you may need to use a deep baking dish instead)
 5. Place your tray in the oven with your grill or broiler set to medium and cook for 3-5 minutes per side, rotating between them. Place them back in the over for 2-3 more minutes until slightly charred. Temperature of the chicken should read 74c or 165f when done.

### Pan Grilled Directions

 1. Heat a grill pan or griddle and place a few chicken thighs in it, but don't overcrowd the pan.
 2. Cook them on medium high heat, flipping them every 3 minutes until cooked through
 3. Remove and slice into thin strips

### To Make a Shawarma Sandwich

 1. Place a piece of bread on your work surface and slather on a couple of tablespoons of Toum or garlic sauce
 2. Add your chicken pieces on top, as well as some pieces of sliced pickle
 3. Add some chilli sauce to the sandwich then roll it up and seal
 4. Place your sandwiches in a grill pan of griddle, and weigh them down with something heavy. Allow them to sear for 30-60 seconds per side until grill marks form.
