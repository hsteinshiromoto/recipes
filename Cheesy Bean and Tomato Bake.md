In 12-inch ovensafe skillet, heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium heat until shimmering, about 2 minutes (oil should be hot but not smoking).

4

Stir in tomatoes, water, and sugar. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer (small bubbles should break often across surface of mixture), stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 10 minutes.

5

Add drained beans to skillet and stir to coat with sauce. Cook, stirring occasionally, until beans are warmed through, about 5 minutes. Turn off heat and slide skillet to cool burner.

Stir Parmesan and half of mozzarella into beans. Spread beans into even layer. Sprinkle remaining mozzarella evenly over top.

7
