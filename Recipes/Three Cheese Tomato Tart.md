# Three Cheese Tomato Tart

## Ingredients

* 2 ripe [[Tomato|tomatoes]], cut into 1/8-inch slices .
* 1 sheet frozen [[puff pastry]].
* 3 tablespoons light [[mayonnaise]].
* 1/2 cup shredded [[Cheddar]].
* 1/2 cup shredded [[mozzarella]] cheese.
* 2 tablespoons finely chopped [[basil]].
* Freshly grated [[Parmiggiano|Parmesan]] cheese.
* Salt and pepper to taste.

## Instructions

1. Preheat [[oven]] to 400Â°F.
2. Lay out the [[tomato]] slices on a large sheet of paper towels. Cover with more paper towels and allow to drain for approximately 30 minutes (this is crucial to not getting a watery tart). Meanwhile, remove the sheet of [[puff pastry]] from the freezer and allow to thaw at room temperature for 30 minutes.
3. Unfold the [[puff pastry]] onto a parchment-lined baking sheet, pinching to close any holes in the seams. Using a fork, prick the dough all over to prevent it from puffing up during baking.
4. Spread a thin layer of [[mayonnaise]] over the entire [[puff pastry]]. Sprinkle evenly with shredded [[cheddar]] and [[mozzarella]] cheeses. Arrange the [[tomato]] slices over the cheese. Season generously with kosher salt and pepper. Grate a generous amount of [[Parmiggiano|Parmesan]] cheese on top and garnish with freshly chopped [[basil]].
5. Bake for 30 minutes, until the pastry is golden brown and the cheese is melted. Remove the pastry from the baking sheet and let cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Cut into 9 squares and serve immediately.
